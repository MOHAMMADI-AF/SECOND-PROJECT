### This Project could be called MERN Stack

    MERN Stack is a compilation of four different technologies that work together to develop dynamic web apps and websites.

    It is a contraction for four different technologies as mentioned below:

    M - MongoDB
    E - ExpressJS
    R - ReactJS
    N - NodeJS

# Getting Started with Create React App

1.  This project will have forntend and backend and the folders are name as required
    I used the (npx) because it does install the required packages for frontend.

    To install the required packages manually you will have to install the following for backend and or frontend:

        npm init -y (or without -y if you want to add info manually)
        npm i express
        npm i -g nodemon (if you have already installed, no need to install again)
        npm install express-react-views react react-dom --save (you do not need to run the command as here you can change it.)

    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is used as code editor for this project.

    This is the first command is used to start my project

        npx create-react-app (folder name)

    The first thing to do, is to generate basically a boilerplate of a react application that includes the library. The easiest ways to do that is with Create React app, more information can be found on:
    https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

    The structure of the folders has been modified some files and folders has been removed which were not needed in this project some new files and folders created which are required for this project. Folders are place to frontend and backend based on the functionality of files that does a specific function to run the application smoothly.
