# The Project

## This is a Per Scholas Software Engineering Class Second Project

### This Project could be called MERN Stack Full Form

    MERN Stack is a compilation of four different technologies that work together to develop dynamic web apps and websites.

    It is a contraction for four different technologies as mentioned below:

    M - MongoDB
    E - ExpressJS
    R - ReactJS
    N - NodeJS

# Getting Started with Create React App

1.  This is the first command is used to start my project
    npx create-react-app (folder name)

    This project will have forntend and backend and the folders are name as required
    I used the (npx) because it does install the required packages for frontend.

    To install the required packages manually you will have to install the following for backend and or frontend:

        npm init -y (or without -y if you want to add info manually)
        npm i express
        npm i -g nodemon (if you have already installed, no need to install again)
        npm install express-react-views react react-dom --save (you do not need to run the command as here you can change it.)

    NOTE: This is not list of all the packages you need to install there are more to be installed. You can install them as per requirement of your application.

2.  For the page layout design I will use components and one of the elements below I will be using is the react components more information is here:
    https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts

    To use bootstrap you need to install the following:

        npm install react-bootstrap

3.  Using the bootstrap i have created the page layout that has the header and footer with will be same for all pages (it is a single page application) when routes are changed and the page contains changed the header and footer will be same for all pages.

4.  To add

        This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
