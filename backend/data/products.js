    description:
      "An Afghan tribal rug is an artistic expression of cultural history and tradition. These rugs are hand-knotted by tribal weavers living nomadic lifestyles, using traditional techniques passed down through generations over hundreds of years. The weavers use entirely hand-spun wool, hand-dyed with natural dyes to weave rugs featuring symbolic designs specific to their tribal heritage. Each design is spontaneously created by an individual weaver, making every Afghan tribal rug a unique item of the weaver artistic expression as well as a record of their cultural heritage.",
